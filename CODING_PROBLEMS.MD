# List of coding problems

Problems sorted starting with the easiest ones that cover important basic concepts. Try to go from top to bottom.


1. [`Two sum`](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/). Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
2. [`Palindrome Number`](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/). Given an integer `x`, return true if `x` is palindrome integer.
3. [`Longest Common Prefix`](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/). Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
4. [`Valid paranthesis`](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/). Given a string s containing just the characters `'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'`, determine if the input string is valid.
5. [`Merge Two Sorted Lists`](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/). You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2. Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
6. [`Search Insert Position`](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/). Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.  You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity. 
7. [`Climbing stairs`](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/). You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
8. [`Merge sorted array`](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/). You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
