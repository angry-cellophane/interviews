14. [`Balanced Binary Tree`](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/). Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
15. [`Path Sum`](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/). Given the root of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.
16. [`Pascal's Triangle`](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/). Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
17. [`Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock`](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/).

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.
18. [`Min Stack`](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/). Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
19. [`Intersection of Two Linked Lists`](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/). Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
20. [`Reverse Linked List`](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/). Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
21. [`Diameter of Binary Tree`](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/). Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
