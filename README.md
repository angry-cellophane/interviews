## Tips

1. Preparation is key. It increases your chances to get an offer a lot. 
Most interviews' formats are not something you do daily (like balancing binary trees or designing type-ahead systems for google search) but they are well defined and it's highly recommended to follow them. Following the format will help you to give more `signals` to the interviewers. They are assessing you on several parameters (e.g. problem solving, communication, coding, testing) and looking for signals for each parameter. 

	Preparation helps you focus on important parts of the interview that give more signals and not to spend time on something that gives fewer signals during the interview. It helps you increase the `density` of your interview if it makes sense. 


2. Recruiters are your best friends. They get a bonus if you get hired, so it's in their interest to make sure you show your best in interviews. 
If you have any question about the interviews or the company, don't be afraid to ask your recruiter.

3. Do some research about the company and the project you're applying to. Make sure you know why you're applying to this particular role, your personal reasons.

4. [Reverse interview](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/reverse-interviewing/) your interviewers, recruiter, future team, manager. Check if the role matches your expectations, if the job is actually what you think it is.
Some companies offer prep calls with engineers. This is the time when you not only can ask questions about the interviews but also what's like to work at that company or team.

5. Prep calls with engineers. Some [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) companies offer prep calls with engineers (1 on 1 or group calls). This is a great opportunity to ask about the format of each interview, what interviewers look at, general tips, what not to do and so on.



## General approach to prepare

1. Understand the format: expectations, how you get evaluated, redflags.
2. Practice.
3. Do mock interviews.


## Format

Usually the interview cycle contains 2 (or 3) steps: `screening` interview and the full set of different interviews (`on-site` interviews).


Companies want to optimize their interview process and not to spend time of their engineers if it's clear that the candidate is not a good match (e.g. irrelevant experience or poor coding skills).


There are four most common types of interviews:
- Coding interview
- Take home assignment
- System, product, api, object-oriented design.
- Behavioural, leadership, culture fit, etc.

### Phone screen interviews

Screening (Phone screen) interview usually takes 1 hour where the interviewer asks you for 45 mins and then you have 15 mins to ask the interviewer back. They are done via some video chat (zoom, hangouts, bluejeans, etc) and online collaborative text editor (some with basic syntax support).
By the end of the interview the interviewer needs to decided whether the candidate has a chance to pass on-site interviews or not.

Different companies use different types of interviews at this stage.
The most common one is a coding interview (more about them below). Ofent it is two different coding promblems you need to solve or one coding problem and then some new conditions that make the problem harder. 

Some companies (like amazon) allocate some time for quick behavioural question, so you would get one coding question and a few behavioural questions (more on behavioural interviews below).

You may have a similar experience with [karat](https://karat.com/) or similar platforms. Some companies outsource phone screen interviews to those external platforms. They usually have a pretty good description of what to expect. Quite often, it is some coding problem and a few question on general knowledge.
